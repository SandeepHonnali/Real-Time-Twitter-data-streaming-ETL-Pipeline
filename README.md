# Real-Time-Twitter-data-streaming-ETL-Pipeline

Real-Time Twitter Data Streaming ETL Pipeline

This project implements a real-time ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for processing and analyzing Twitter data streams. Leveraging the Twitter API and Apache Kafka, it continuously ingests tweets, performs preprocessing and transformation tasks using Apache Spark Streaming, and loads the processed data into a data warehouse or analytics platform.

Key Features:

Twitter Data Ingestion: Utilizes the Twitter API to fetch real-time tweets based on user-defined keywords or hashtags, ensuring a constant stream of data for analysis.

Apache Kafka Integration: Integrates with Apache Kafka to facilitate scalable, fault-tolerant data ingestion and processing. Kafka topics are used to partition and distribute tweet data across multiple processing nodes.

Apache Spark Streaming: Processes streaming data using Apache Spark Streaming, enabling real-time analysis, filtering, and transformation of tweets. Implements windowed operations and stateful processing for advanced analytics.

ETL Pipeline: Implements a robust ETL pipeline to extract relevant information from raw tweet data, transform it into structured formats, and load it into a data warehouse or analytics database for further analysis and visualization.

Data Quality and Governance: Implements data quality checks and validation rules to ensure the integrity and reliability of the processed data. Incorporates mechanisms for error handling, deduplication, and data cleansing to maintain data consistency.

Technologies Used:

Apache Kafka
Apache Spark (Spark Streaming)
Twitter API
Python (PySpark)
Apache Hadoop (optional)
Data Warehouse or Analytics Platform (e.g., AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery)

Usage:

Configure Twitter API credentials and Kafka settings in the configuration file.
Start the Kafka cluster and create necessary topics for tweet ingestion.
Run the Spark Streaming application to consume tweets from Kafka, perform ETL operations, and store processed data.
